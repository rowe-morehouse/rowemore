<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 300">ðŸ”¥ Uncertainty is the day-to-day reality for product managers who build digital products. Software development by its nature is complex and dynamic â€” both technically and organizationally â€” and the product manager is right there at the center of it all. Let's look at some concepts and tactics designed to help you address ambiguity, risk, and uncertainty in your initiatives.</span>

RAISE YOUR HAND IF you've been on a team that's experienced scope creep â€” you've had to deal new requirements coming in while your product initiative is in-flight or about to ship.

â€¦ Almost everyone, right?

Whether the forces are internal or external, the beautiful roadmap you worked so hard on is likely to be impacted on a weekly basis. To solve for this inevitability, let's take a look at the following:

- Product Vision, Mission, and Principles as tools to hedge against uncertainty
- Managing expectations around timelines and delivery dates
- Using **a risk management model** to Log risks, question assumptions, and identify dependencies
- Building a culture that is flexible and accepts uncertainty
- Using clarity and coherence in communication when certainty is not available

Software development involves making many hypotheses and then proving or disproving them through experiments and testing. It's not always known which direction a product may be heading, or how soon it's going to get there. 

Despite this fundamental ambiguity, it's our job as PMs to lead our teams and **gain the confidence of diverse stakeholders**. PMs are often seen as gatekeepers of the product, and each stakeholder arrives at that gate with a different perspective and different expectations. 

Then from a technical perspective there are always many moving-parts, risks,  and dependencies.

Nevertheless, as product managers, <mark class="b">people are looking to us for clarity</mark> â€” and they want to be able to trust us. How we communicate under ambiguous conditions directly affects our credibility as well as the perception of our job performance.

### Addressing uncertainty in producty strategy

Depending on your organization you may have a very formal strategy, you may have an ad hoc strategy, or you may have no strategy at all.

Regardless, you as a PM <u>should know the "true north" for your product</u>. In the context of managing uncertainty, your true north at the very minimum gives you a vision, a mission, and then clear metrics that follow from and align with the vision and mission. 

<blockquote>Ask yourself: What is the reason you exist as a product team? What value do you bring to the world?</blockquote>

Your product principles are derived from your vision and mission. Product principles are the DNA of your product; the fundamental values that should undergird every product decision. Product principles are not KPIs, they are not targets, and they're never "reached" â€” <strong>they exist as a steady rubric to guide you</strong>. You can look to them when you question or reassess what you're actually building.

Ideally your product principles shouldn't change, or when they do change, it's done very intentionally. They should be written to persevere through changes in staffing, market conditions, tech stacks, and other future contexts.

The benefit of having clear principles is they offer clarity and consistency not only to your product, but also to your process. More clarity is more certainty, and more certainty is less uncertainty.

Clear product principles <mark class="b">can also help align people or groups</mark> during a disagreement or an impasse.

For example let's say you have a feature you're trying to launch but it requires coordination with another team â€” and your team and the other team have a strong disagreement, or a historically rocky relationship. If there are clear product principles in place, then at the very least <strong>both teams can align</strong> around those and work from there.

On a tactical level, simply writing down what you DO know â€”Â even in a simple unordered list â€” can be valuable. Make sure your "knowns" are data-driven and not just assumptions.

For example in your list of knowns you can say something like "last quarter we went out with this feature to a subset of our users, but we had to roll it back because we learned XYZ."

That's a true factual known that you can incorporate into your next steps. What else do your past experiments prove or disprove? More knowns equal more clarity and more certainty. 

Or perhaps <strong>you need to revisit the assumptions</strong> inherent to your knowns. An example of this is you may have a learning from a past experiment, but the product has changed a great deal since then. You may be hanging on to a murky datapoint. You may need to revisit your assumptions. Examining your assumptions is managing uncertainty.

### Uncertainty in roadmapping & prioritization

There's always a high level of uncertainty when you start putting together roadmaps and timelines. This is why product managers <mark class="y">are often uncomfortable</mark> giving milestone ETAs for a project or initiative.

Contexts change all the time, so PMs often <u>don't want to make a timeframe commitment</u> to an important stakeholder. It's scary to commit to uncertain timelines.

<blockquote>So what happens when you're deflecting questions all the time and your lack of communication around timeframes becomes commonplace?</blockquote>

What happens is stakeholders start feeling a lack of visibility, and start sensing that milestones are always being postponed. This erodes trust and impacts your credibility â€” and the credibility of your&nbsp;team. 

There are, however, some tactical moves you can make to mitigate this situation.

### ðŸ’¥ Use a Risk Management model as a tool for managing uncertainty

A "<a class="external" href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/raid-Log.php" target="_blank">RAID Log</a>" is a light-weight risk management tool. You can <a class="external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mrcHRwuu3HHXYEM3jFCi7IuXwt-jt5mzVFToJhQAEio/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">make a copy of my template here</a>.


Your RAID Log helps you identify project <u>**R**</u>isks, <u>**A**</u>ssumptions, <u>**I**</u>ssues, and <u>**D**</u>ependencies. It's smart to incorporate a RAID Log into every initiative you're proposing or working on.

It could be a large initiative â€” or it could be something incemental, like a 3 day sprint â€” but just by having a RAID in writing you add some clarity and you demonstrate your level-of-effort in trying to inject more certainty into the development process. Add your RAID Log into whatever document you're circulating among your team, partners, and stakeholders. Make it visible, make it public.

When you have a list of risks in your back pocket, if you're pressed for a delivery date, you can say something like "I'm not sure how an ETA can be articulated right now when XYZ is a big unknown."

Your log <strong>gives you something to point to and refer back to</strong>. It gives you a reason to offer to stakeholders regarding your hesitance to give a straightforward ETA.

You can say "Let me go through some of these unknowns and dependencies real quick so you can see how they may impact our timeline."

Your RAID Log is also useful to reference during daily standups and weekly updates. It offers a rationale for your positions and also brings clarity to the overall effort.

### Always be prepared for multiple possible outcomes!

Think about all possible likely outcomes for your sprint, or your financial quarter. You have your happy path â€” but what is the array of other probable outcomes?

Use your brainstorming skills and leverage the tribal knowledge of your organization to make a list of all potential outcomes. It's a valuable skill to be able look at any initiative and think through the different ways things may turn out. 

If you've determined some potential undesirable outcomes, then by all means discuss them with your team.

â€¦ In the case an undesirable outcome occurs, you've lessened the severity of the whiplash teams often face when they're forced to switch directions mid-stream. If they expect the possibility of changing requirements then the thrash and churn won't hurt  quite as bad. 

By all means, do not try to cheerlead your happy path while ignoring a negative reality. Manage expectations by truthfully communicating the potential that things may change. Point to your RAID Log as evidence of possible directions. <strong>You will benefit</strong> from removing any false sense of certainty.

Ask your team to please try to be flexible and resilient in the face of changing conditions. You can <u>build a culture of accepting uncertainty</u> if you demonstrate you have carefully thought about possible undesirable outcomes, and show that you've put measures in place to avoid them. 

### Don't hesitate to overcommunicate. Here's why:

Express your perspectives multiple times â€” even if you think your team and stakeholders have already heard and understood your analyses. Consider the different expectations that may be held by diverse stakeholders. Manage expectations by tailoring your message to those different audiences. 

If you tell a stakeholder, for example, that a specific milestone is going to be reached by May 15, and then you don't hit it, and you're penalized, then you're going to be less inclined to provide forthcoming and transparent updates in the future. 

The same goes for your team. You <strong>want them to have the psychological safety needed</strong> to give their best "blameless" estimations in the context of a culture that accepts uncertainty.

Of course you still need to put change-control procedures in place at the beginning of any initiative, and do your best to keep execution on track while in-flight. Your projections should be as accurate as they can be, but it's best that everyone accept that circumstances often change.

<blockquote>You are not sandbagging. You are not padding the schedule. You are not giving yourself some "wiggle room." You are planning for the complexity of software development. The scope, scale, and requirements of software projects change. They always do.</blockquote>

## Facing uncertainty in execution?

The best thing you can do is communicate as clearly as possible. Lay the facts (datapoints) out on the table. Lay the risks and assumptions on the table. During your updates, communicate a cohesive narrative using the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=minto+pyramid+principle" target="new">Minto Pyramid Principal</a> formula. 

The coherence of your arguments has the ability to trump uncertainty. Generate a persuasive message that shows you're addressing uncertainty as best as can be expected, and connect that message to the bigger picture of where you're headed with the product â€” even in light of the messiness and chaos your initiative may be experiencing. 

Your communications goal should be to clearly articulate what's happening â€” whether that be good or bad â€“ and especially when it's bad. <mark class="r">Don't take it personally</mark>. Discuss progress in the third person. Be objective. Be blameless, and don't blame.

The real problem is when PMs manufacture certainty when in reality there are known or newly identified obstacles. People will inevitably sniff this out and it will hurt your credibility. 

Conversely, your ability to discuss messy and ambiguous situations in a super-clear and coherent way <strong>will enhance your credibility</strong>. When you outline disagreements and articulate tradeoffs you are providing more clarity and more certainty. 

Try this simple formula when you need to give an update. Tell them:

1. What you DO know
2. what you DON'T know
3. What you WILL know

Then provide a pyramid argument while pointing at your RAID Log.

The lesson is to think carefully about risks, and think carefully in advance about how you talk about your progress in light of those risks. Be super proactive in your communication ESPECIALLY when there are problems or ambiguity. You are not "bothering" people by keeping them  asynchronously updated. More communication can only help, not hurt.

## Product Management is tricky â€¦

In actuality you are not only solving for your users' problems, you are also solving for the problems of your team and your organization â€¦ and you always have to be looking out for yourself at the same time!

## Summary

- Try to get comfortable talking about uncertainty and strategizing around it.
- When you discuss strategy and execution, have your true north and your product principles very clearly defined.
- Spend time iterating on your risks, assumption, issues and dependencies. Your RAID Log is a living document to be continuously updated. You may even want to develop encapsulated RAID logs for short-term intervals like a sprint.
- Using your RAID Log as a public reference, manage expectations with considered arguments that position near-term messiness and uncertainty in relation to a larger big picture outcome.  
- Make an explicit goal of growing a blameless, flexible culture of accepting uncertainty.
